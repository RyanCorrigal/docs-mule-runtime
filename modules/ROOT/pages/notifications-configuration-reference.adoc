== Notifications

Registers listeners for notifications, and associates interfaces with specific events.

=== Attributes of Notifications

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description
|`dynamic` |If the notification manager is dynamic, you can set up the listeners to be registered dynamically at runtime. Otherwise, some parts of Mule cache the notification configurations for efficiency and do not generate events for newly-enabled notifications or listeners. See https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/3.9/mule-server-notifications#registering-listeners-programmatically for more information. +
*Type*: `boolean` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: `false`
|===

=== Child Elements of Notifications
Use the `notification` and `disable-notification` elements to configure the relationship between interfaces and events.
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|`notification` |0..* |Associates an event with an interface. Listeners that implement the interface receive instances of the event. The `notification` and `disable-notification` elements configure the relationship between interfaces and events.
|`disable-notification` |0..* |Blocks the association of an event with a particular interface. This filters events after the association with a particular interface, so it takes precedence over other elements, such as `notification-listener`.
|`notification-listener` |0..* |Registers a bean as a listener with the notification system. Events are dispatched by reflection, which means that the listener receives all events associated with the interfaces it implements.
|===

== Notification

Associates an event with an interface. Listeners that implement the interface will receive instances of the event.

=== Attributes of Notification

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description
|`event-class` |The class associated with a notification event to deliver to the interface. You can use this instead of the `event` attribute to specify a custom class. +
*Type*: `class name` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`event` |The notification event to deliver. +
*Type*: `notificationTypes` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`interface-class` |The class name of the interface that receives the notification event. +
*Type*: `class name` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`interface` |The name of the interface that receives the notification event. +
*Type*: `notificationTypes` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|===

There are no child elements for `notification`.

== Disable Notification

Blocks the association of an event with a particular interface. This filters events after the association with a particular interface, so it takes precedence over over other elements, such as `notification-listener`.

=== Attributes of disable-notification

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Name |Description
|`event-class` |The class associated with an event that is no longer delivered to any interface. You can use this instead of the  attribute to specify a custom class. +
*Type*: `class name` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`event` |The event you no longer want to deliver. +
*Type*: `notificationTypes` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`interface-class` |The class name of the interface that no longer receives the event. +
*Type*: `class name` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|`interface` |The name of the interface that no longer receives the event. +
*Type*: `notificationTypes` +
*Required*: no +
*Default*: none
|===

There are no child elements for `disable-notification`.

== Notification Listener

Registers a bean as a listener with the notification system. Events are dispatched by reflection. The listener
receives all events associated with any interface it implements.

== Notification Types

You can specify the following types of notifications using the `event` attribute of the `notification` and `disable-notification` element:

* ASYNC-MESSAGE
* COMPONENT-MESSAGE
* CONNECTION
* CONTEXT
* CUSTOM
* ENDPOINT-MESSAGE
* EXCEPTION
* EXCEPTION-STRATEGY
* MANAGEMENT
* MESSAGE-PROCESSOR
* MODEL
* PIPELINE-MESSAGE
* REGISTRY
* ROUTING
* SECURITY
* SERVICE
* TRANSACTION
